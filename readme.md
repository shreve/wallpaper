Wallpaper
=========

A CLI for fetching and saving wallpaper-sized images from Unsplash.com. By
default, it lets you try out new ones and save the ones you like.

Currently a first draft.

Todo:
* Extract library
* Generalize permanent path
* Generalize command to set wallpaper
* Add gallery mode to quickly try out multiple results for same query
* Remove reliance on exec.Command if possible
